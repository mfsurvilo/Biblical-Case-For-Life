****This is not a defense of the bible. This study will operate under the assumption that the Bible is the word of God and God's character and heart have been revealed for us to discover in both the old and new testaments. 

Analogies will be drawn and assumed between the nation of God - Israel and Judah and modern day Christians. 

A note on old testament passages. Although the punishment for sin has always been death, post-Christ those who trust in His sacrificial work do not have to bear the punishments seen in the old testament. This does not mean that God's character and value system observed in the old testament no longer applies. bad wording

What is the purpose of numbers, leviticus etc. How did the nation of israel compare to the sorrounding ungodly nations. What's the context. Perhaps extra-biblically.

What purpose was given to the animals? How about man?
In what ways is the creation of man unique from animals?

Read the following and note any repeated words. 
> [!bible] [Ecclesiastes 3:11 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/21/3/)
> 11. He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, yet so that man will not find out the work which God has done from the beginning even to the end.

What is the subject matter of the previous verses?

What timeline was man made for?

While the bible does not specifically say that animals do not have eternal life it is clear that God's heart, and Jesus' ministry are centered around the human soul and life not perishing. 

> [!bible] [Leviticus 24:17-22 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/3/24/)
> 17. 'If a man takes the life of any human being, he shall surely be put to death.

What was the punishment for taking the life of someone's animal?
What was the punishment for taking the life of another man?
What does this reveal about the hierarchy of the value of life in God's kingdom?

Based on the two sections above why does human life have inherent value?

## Human Rights

Below we will take a look at passages that highlight key principles related to human rights. These will be broken down into 8 separate categories. 

**Inherent Human Dignity:**
The previous section covered the intrinsic worth humans have based on man's creation for eternity in the image of God. Additionally, the fact that we are God's handiwork means that all humans that walk this earth are precious. Being created for purpose means that our time on earth is valuable as well. 

Maybe talk about John the baptist being given purpose and samuel see ref below and paul called from the womb 

> [!bible] [Ephesians 2:10 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/49/2/)
> 10. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.

**Right to Life:**
We will cover man's right to life in the section below entitled Murder vs Killing.

**Equality:** what type of equality be less general perhaps
> [!bible] [Leviticus 19:15 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/3/19/)
> 15. 'You shall do no injustice in judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great, but you are to judge your neighbor fairly.

Verse 28 highlights three relationships that would have had inherent hierarchy in the first century. What are these relationships? 

Paul writes to the budding young church in Galatia describing how they are to treat one another. The church was made of a socio-economically diverse group of Christ followers.

He contrasts 3 different relationships, in what sense do they have equality? In what ways will they stay unique?

> [!bible] [Galatians 3:25-30 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/48/3/)
> 25. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.
> 26. For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
> 27. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
> 28. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
> 29. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants, heirs according to promise.

###  Justice and Fair Treatment:
> [!bible] [Exodus 23:2-9 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/2/23/)
> 2. 'You shall not follow the masses in doing evil, nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to turn aside after a multitude in order to pervert [justice];
> 3. nor shall you be partial to a poor man in his dispute.
> 4. 'If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey wandering away, you shall surely return it to him.
> 5. 'If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying [helpless] under its load, you shall refrain from leaving it to him, you shall surely release [it] with him.
> 6. 'You shall not pervert the justice [due] to your needy [brother] in his dispute.
> 7. 'Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent or the righteous, for I will not acquit the guilty.
> 8. 'You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the cause of the just.
> 9. 'You shall not oppress a stranger, since you yourselves know the feelings of a stranger, for you [also] were strangers in the land of Egypt.


> [!bible] [Proverbs 31:8-9 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/20/31/)
> 8. Open your mouth for the mute, For the rights of all the unfortunate.
> 9. Open your mouth, judge righteously, And defend the rights of the afflicted and needy.

> [!bible] [Leviticus 19:15 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/3/19/)
> 15. 'You shall do no injustice in judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great, but you are to judge your neighbor fairly.

How do the proverbs describe the unfortunate? 
What do the proverbs tell us to do?
Based on Proverbs 31, who are the most voiceless people in today's society? 


### Advocacy for the Vulnerable:
> [!bible] [Luke 4:18 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/42/4/)
> 18. 'THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR. HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM RELEASE TO THE CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET FREE THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED,

Christ came as the ultimate advocate for the marginalized. He came not to save the powerful, but the oppressed. What freedom do those who have everything need?
### Freedom of Conscience and Faith:
> [!bible] [Luke 9:49-50 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/42/9/)
> 49. John answered and said, 'Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name; and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow along with us.'
> 50. But Jesus said to him, 'Do not hinder [him]; for he who is not against you is for you.'


### Mutual Respect and Reciprocity:

### Treatment of Women:
maybe not separate - maybe stick with relational equality before christ. 

> [!bible] [Luke 10:38-39 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/42/10/)
> 38. Now as they were traveling along, He entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.
> 39. She had a sister called Mary, who was seated at the Lord's feet, listening to His word.

## When Does Life Begin?

> [!bible] [Luke 1:41-44 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/42/1/)
> 41. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.

> 43. 'And how has it [happened] to me, that the mother of my Lord would come to me?
> 44. 'For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.

In the above passage was the baby (John the baptist) conscious of his surroundings?
Why did God make sure this story was recorded in Luke's gospel?




Who opens the womb?

> [!bible] [Psalm 139:13-16 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/19/139/)
> 13. For You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother's womb.

Job is in the midst of enduring immense suffering. He has lost children, wealth, and health. During this time he begins to lament his very existence. Let's see if we can identify any clues to the when life begins. 
> [!bible] [Job 3:1-9 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/18/3/)
> 1. Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his [birth].
> 2. And Job said,
> 3. 'Let the day perish on which I was to be born, And the night [which] said, 'A boy is conceived.'
> 4. 'May that day be darkness; Let not God above care for it, Nor light shine on it.
> 5. 'Let darkness and black gloom claim it; Let a cloud settle on it; Let the blackness of the day terrify it.
> 6. '[As for] that night, let darkness seize it; Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.
> 7. 'Behold, let that night be barren; Let no joyful shout enter it.
> 8. 'Let those curse it who curse the day, Who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.

How does Job feel about his existence?

Does Job mention his conception? 
Why do you think he makes a distinction between the day of his birth and the night of his conception?

> [!bible] [Job 3:10-16 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/18/3/)

> 15. Or with princes who had gold, Who were filling their houses [with] silver.
> 16. 'Or like a miscarriage which is discarded, I would not be, As infants that never saw light.

In verse 16 does Job recognize the humanity of the unborn child?

We don't hear a response to Job's laments for 35 chapters. Let's read what God says about His creation. 

Based on these passages does God place different value on life outside the womb vs inside the womb?
What to do with this?

## Murder vs Killing
Murder is typically understood as the **intentional, unlawful, and unjust** taking of an innocent life. 

Perhaps highlight innocent life vs someone actively committing a crime. 


maybe highlight us law

> 23. or with any deadly object of stone, and without seeing it dropped on him so that he died, while he was not his enemy nor seeking his injury,
> 24. then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the blood avenger according to these ordinances.
> 25. 'The congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the blood avenger, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge to which he fled; and he shall live in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.

Wartime killing

Some will claim that the Levitical laws sited above are not longer relevant for a nation of people more diverse than Israel. What empire ran the government during the first century AD?

> 11. Jesus answered, 'You would have no authority over Me, unless it had been given you from above; for this reason he who delivered Me to you has [the] greater sin.'

Does Jesus recognize the authority that the civil government has to execute capital punishment?

> [!bible] [Romans 13:1-7 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/45/13/)
> 1. Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.
> 2. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.
> 3. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same;
> 4. for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.
> 5. Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.
> 6. For because of this you also pay taxes, for [rulers] are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.
> 7. Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax [is due]; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.

Where does a government's authority to make these decisions come from?

Based on what you've read above, does the intent of the death make a moral difference according to scripture?

### Child Sacrifice - Molech
Molech was a God of what people group? Ammonites
Were the Ammonites and Israelites living together in the same region? No, they were neighbors though. See duet2:19


What are the sins God condemns with regard to Molech worship? 
	Idolatry and murder
	
What idols are people worshiping in modern society when they choose abortion?
	Comfort, career, success, money, stability, power, convenience, immorality, pride
	
Is God's issue with the method of killing or with the act itself?

This is not the first time God has seen what's going in now . There are nations all around them

## Should believers "impose" their beliefs on the culture?
Some people say that America is not a christian nation. Should this matter? Let's explore what God says about culture at large. 


Where to put. see last passage
[Leviticus 24:17-22 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/3/24/)

17. 'If a man takes the life of any human being, he shall surely be put to death.
18. 'The one who takes the life of an animal shall make it good, life for life.
19. 'If a man injures his neighbor, just as he has done, so it shall be done to him:
20. fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; just as he has injured a man, so it shall be inflicted on him.
21. 'Thus the one who kills an animal shall make it good, but the one who kills a man shall be put to death.
22. 'There shall be one standard for you; it shall be for the stranger as well as the native, for I am the LORD your God.''





### God's people living in a foreign land.
The first century Christians were a minority group in their land. 
> [!bible] [Philippians 2:14-16 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/50/2/)
> 14. Do all things without grumbling or disputing;
> 15. so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,
> 16. holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain.

> [!bible] [Matthew 5:13-16 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/40/5/)
> 13. 'You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty [again]? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.
> 14. 'You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;
> 15. nor does [anyone] light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.
> 16. 'Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

How does Christ say that we should live? How about Paul?
 
### God's people looking at a foreign land
"America isn't a christian nation, who cares what they do."

Does God care how those who don't claim to follow Him live?
Below we read about the Ammonites. These are the same people group who sacrificed their children to their god Molech. 
> [!bible] [Amos 1:13-15 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/30/1/)
> 13. Thus says the LORD, 'For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon and for four I will not revoke its [punishment], Because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead In order to enlarge their borders.
> 14. 'So I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah And it will consume her citadels Amid war cries on the day of battle, And a storm on the day of tempest.
> 15. 'Their king will go into exile, He and his princes together,' says the LORD.


> [!bible] [Psalm 96:5 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/19/96/)
> 5. For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the LORD made the heavens.

 Based on Pslam 96, why might God care what the people who do not claim to follow him do?

> [!bible] [Leviticus 18:24-30 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/3/18/)
> 24. 'Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled.
> 25. 'For the land has become defiled, therefore I have brought its punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants.
> 26. 'But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and My judgments and shall not do any of these abominations, [neither] the native, nor the alien who sojourns among you
> 27. (for the men of the land who have been before you have done all these abominations, and the land has become defiled);
> 28. so that the land will not spew you out, should you defile it, as it has spewed out the nation which has been before you.
> 29. 'For whoever does any of these abominations, those persons who do [so] shall be cut off from among their people.
> 30. 'Thus you are to keep My charge, that you do not practice any of the abominable customs which have been practiced before you, so as not to defile yourselves with them; I am the LORD your God.''


What does God say about His people transforming into the image of culture?

What does God say about the worship and sin of nations that live apart from God's people?

### God's people being affected by the ungodly

Esther and mordecai - keeping peace being affected by the ungodly 


> [!bible] [Isaiah 2:6-8 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/23/2/)
> 6. For You have abandoned Your people, the house of Jacob, Because they are filled [with influences] from the east, And [they are] soothsayers like the Philistines, And they strike [bargains] with the children of foreigners.
> 7. Their land has also been filled with silver and gold And there is no end to their treasures; Their land has also been filled with horses And there is no end to their chariots.
> 8. Their land has also been filled with idols; They worship the work of their hands, That which their fingers have made.


> [!bible] [Romans 12:2 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/45/12/)
> 2. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.

Based on the previous passage what are three ways someone can tell a follow of Christ from a follower of the world's ways?

> [!bible] [1 John 2:15-17 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/62/2/)
> 15. Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
> 16. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.
> 17. The world is passing away, and [also] its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives forever.


> [!bible] [1 Peter 2:9-12 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/60/2/)
> 9. But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR [God's] OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;
> 10. for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY.
> 11. Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.
> 12. Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe [them], glorify God in the day of visitation.
## Is believing enough?

> [!bible] [Micah 6:8 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/33/6/)
> 8. He has told you, O man, what is good; And what does the LORD require of you But to do justice, to love kindness, And to walk humbly with your God?

> [!bible] [Proverbs 31:8-9 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/20/31/)
> 8. Open your mouth for the mute, For the rights of all the unfortunate.
> 9. Open your mouth, judge righteously, And defend the rights of the afflicted and needy.

Who is the most voiceless group in our society? The group of people with the least rights?

> [!bible] [1 Samuel 15:22 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/9/15/)
> 22. Samuel said, 'Has the LORD as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices As in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, [And] to heed than the fat of rams.

> [!bible] [Deuteronomy 10:12-13 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/5/10/)
> 12. 'Now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require from you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
> 13. [and] to keep the LORD'S commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good?

> [!bible] [Proverbs 14:23 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/20/14/)
> 23. In all labor there is profit, But mere talk [leads] only to poverty.

> [!bible] [1 John 3:18 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/62/3/)
> 18. Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth.

> [!bible] [Ephesians 5:11 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/49/5/)
> 11. Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;


What does it mean to love "in deed and truth" as opposed to "with word or with tongue"?
How will we know that we are loving in deed and truth?

> [!bible] [James 1:22-25 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/59/1/)
> 22. But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.
> 23. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;
> 24. for [once] he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.
> 25. But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the [law] of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does.

Are you a doer of the word or a hearer? How do you know?

The following are passages that highlight one of the ways we can know we are doing Christs will and not merely paying lip service to the living God.

> 15. but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always [being] ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence;
> 16. and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame.
> 17. For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong.

> 14. If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
> 15. Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler;

> [!bible] [John 16:33 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/43/16/)
> 33. 'These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.'

> 15. 'I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil [one].
> 16. 'They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.


If you were really to stand up for the most disadvantaged in our society what would it cost you? In what ways might you have to suffer?

What about protecting good witness and relationships with non-believers. The following passages talk about our conduct before the world. 


> [!bible] [Matthew 10:34-36 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/40/10/)
> 34. 'Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
> 35. 'For I came to SET A MAN AGAINST HIS FATHER, AND A DAUGHTER AGAINST HER MOTHER, AND A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AGAINST HER MOTHER-IN-LAW;
> 36. and A MAN'S ENEMIES WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD.



What type of peace are we looking for. What does god look for in peace. Are we going to find that on earth. 
Consider the distinction between peacekeepers (passive) and peacemakers (active). 
Highlight all uses of the word peace. 

> [!bible] [Romans 12:18 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/45/12/)
> 18. If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.

The passage above implores us to live at peace if possible. Search the following scriptures and highlight possible reasons that would disrupt that peace. What does God appear to value over peace?

> [!bible] [Matthew 5:9 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/40/5/)
> 9. 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.

> [!bible] [Hebrews 12:14 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/58/12/)

> 17. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy.
> 18. And the seed whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

Is the peace mentioned above, a peace that must be achieved through action OR a peace that already exists, that will be disrupted by action on the part of God's people?

> [!bible] [1 Corinthians 1:18 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/46/1/)
> 18. For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.

> 18. 'If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before [it hated] you.

> [!bible] [Ephesians 5:11 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/49/5/)
> 11. Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;

In an attempt to make God's character more palatable to the perishing, do you compromise your true witness of God's heart?

Do you come across people who believe your way of life is foolish? Why or why not?

Some who do not understand biology will equate the ending of a created being with the prevention of life through contraception.  *While God gave the command to be fruitful and multiply it is arguable whether or not he opposes any form of birth control. Maybe lose this sentence.* 
The following passage is sometimes misquoted as supporting this biologically mis-informed viewpoint. 
God cares about lineages and family lines. 

> [!bible] [Genesis 38:8-10 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/1/38/)
> 8. Then Judah said to Onan, 'Go in to your brother's wife, and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.'
> 9. Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother's wife, he wasted his seed on the ground in order not to give offspring to his brother.
> 10. But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD; so He took his life also.

The explicit definition of Onan's duty is not outlined till later. 
> [!bible] [Deuteronomy 25:5-10 - NASB](https://bolls.life/NASB/5/25/)
> 5. 'When brothers live together and one of them dies and has no son, the wife of the deceased shall not be [married] outside [the family] to a strange man. Her husband's brother shall go in to her and take her to himself as wife and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her.
> 6. 'It shall be that the firstborn whom she bears shall assume the name of his dead brother, so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel.
> 7. 'But if the man does not desire to take his brother's wife, then his brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the elders and say, 'My husband's brother refuses to establish a name for his brother in Israel; he is not willing to perform the duty of a husband's brother to me.'
> 8. 'Then the elders of his city shall summon him and speak to him. And [if] he persists and says, 'I do not desire to take her,'
> 9. then his brother's wife shall come to him in the sight of the elders, and pull his sandal off his foot and spit in his face; and she shall declare, 'Thus it is done to the man who does not build up his brother's house.'
> 10. 'In Israel his name shall be called, 'The house of him whose sandal is removed.'
