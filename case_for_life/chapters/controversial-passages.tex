\chapter{Controversial Passages}

\begin{scripture}[Genesis 22:1-19]
    \vs{1}Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, 'Abraham!' And he said, 'Here I am.'
    \vs{2}He said, 'Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.'
    \vs{3}So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.
    \vs{4}On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance.
    \vs{5}Abraham said to his young men, 'Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go over there; and we will worship and return to you.'
    \vs{6}Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together.
    \vs{7}Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, 'My father!' And he said, 'Here I am, my son.' And he said, 'Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?'
    \vs{8}Abraham said, 'God will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.' So the two of them walked on together.
    \vs{9}Then they came to the place of which God had told him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
    \vs{10}Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
    \vs{11}But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, 'Abraham, Abraham!' And he said, 'Here I am.'
    \vs{12}He said, 'Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.'
    \vs{13}Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and behold, behind [him] a ram caught in the thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the place of his son.
    \vs{14}Abraham called the name of that place The LORD Will Provide, as it is said to this day, 'In the mount of the LORD it will be provided.'
    \vs{15}Then the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven,
    \vs{16}and said, 'By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son,
    \vs{17}indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies.
    \vs{18}'In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.'
    \vs{19}So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham lived at Beersheba.

\begin{scripture}[Numbers 5:11-31]
    \vs{11}Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
    \vs{12}'Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'If any man's wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him,
    \vs{13}and a man has intercourse with her and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and she is undetected, although she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act,
    \vs{14}if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has defiled herself, or if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has not defiled herself,
    \vs{15}the man shall then bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring [as] an offering for her one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall not pour oil on it nor put frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of memorial, a reminder of iniquity.
    \vs{16}'Then the priest shall bring her near and have her stand before the LORD,
    \vs{17}and the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel; and he shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put [it] into the water.
    \vs{18}'The priest shall then have the woman stand before the LORD and let [the hair of] the woman's head go loose, and place the grain offering of memorial in her hands, which is the grain offering of jealousy, and in the hand of the priest is to be the water of bitterness that brings a curse.
    \vs{19}'The priest shall have her take an oath and shall say to the woman, 'If no man has lain with you and if you have not gone astray into uncleanness, [being] under [the authority of] your husband, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings a curse;
    \vs{20}if you, however, have gone astray, [being] under [the authority of] your husband, and if you have defiled yourself and a man other than your husband has had intercourse with you'
    \vs{21}(then the priest shall have the woman swear with the oath of the curse, and the priest shall say to the woman), 'the LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people by the LORD'S making your thigh waste away and your abdomen swell;
    \vs{22}and this water that brings a curse shall go into your stomach, and make your abdomen swell and your thigh waste away.' And the woman shall say, 'Amen. Amen.'
    \vs{23}'The priest shall then write these curses on a scroll, and he shall wash them off into the water of bitterness.
    \vs{24}'Then he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings a curse, so that the water which brings a curse will go into her and [cause] bitterness.
    \vs{25}'The priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman's hand, and he shall wave the grain offering before the LORD and bring it to the altar;
    \vs{26}and the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering as its memorial offering and offer [it] up in smoke on the altar, and afterward he shall make the woman drink the water.
    \vs{27}'When he has made her drink the water, then it shall come about, if she has defiled herself and has been unfaithful to her husband, that the water which brings a curse will go into her and [cause] bitterness, and her abdomen will swell and her thigh will waste away, and the woman will become a curse among her people.
    \vs{28}'But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will then be free and conceive children.
    \vs{29}'This is the law of jealousy: when a wife, [being] under [the authority of] her husband, goes astray and defiles herself,
    \vs{30}or when a spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife, he shall then make the woman stand before the LORD, and the priest shall apply all this law to her.
    \vs{31}'Moreover, the man will be free from guilt, but that woman shall bear her guilt.''

\begin{scripture}[Genesis 38:8-10]
    \vs{8}Then Judah said to Onan, 'Go in to your brother's wife, and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.'
    \vs{9}Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother's wife, he wasted his seed on the ground in order not to give offspring to his brother.
    \vs{10}But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD; so He took his life also.
\end{scripture}

\begin{scripture}[Deuteronomy 25:5-10]
    \vs{5}'When brothers live together and one of them dies and has no son, the wife of the deceased shall not be [married] outside [the family] to a strange man. Her husband's brother shall go in to her and take her to himself as wife and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her.
    \vs{6}'It shall be that the firstborn whom she bears shall assume the name of his dead brother, so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel.
    \vs{7}'But if the man does not desire to take his brother's wife, then his brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the elders and say, 'My husband's brother refuses to establish a name for his brother in Israel; he is not willing to perform the duty of a husband's brother to me.'
    \vs{8}'Then the elders of his city shall summon him and speak to him. And [if] he persists and says, 'I do not desire to take her,'
    \vs{9}then his brother's wife shall come to him in the sight of the elders, and pull his sandal off his foot and spit in his face; and she shall declare, 'Thus it is done to the man who does not build up his brother's house.'
    \vs{10}'In Israel his name shall be called, 'The house of him whose sandal is removed.'
