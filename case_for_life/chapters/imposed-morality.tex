Some people say that America is not a christian nation. Should this matter? Let's explore what God says about culture at large.

\begin{scripture}[Philippians 2:14-16]
    \vs{14}Do all things without grumbling or disputing;
    \vs{15}so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,
    \vs{16}holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain.
\end{scripture}

\begin{scripture}[Matthew 5:13-16]
    \vs{13}'You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty [again]? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.
    \vs{14}'You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;
    \vs{15}nor does [anyone] light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.
    \vs{16}'Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
\end{scripture}

\section{God's People Looking at Foreign Nations}

\begin{scripture}[Amos 1:13-15]
    \vs{13}Thus says the LORD, 'For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon and for four I will not revoke its [punishment], Because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead In order to enlarge their borders.
    \vs{14}'So I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah And it will consume her citadels Amid war cries on the day of battle, And a storm on the day of tempest.
    \vs{15}'Their king will go into exile, He and his princes together,' says the LORD.
\end{scripture}

    \vs{5}For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the LORD made the heavens.
\end{scripture}

\vspace{2\baselineskip}

\begin{scripture}[Leviticus 18:24-30]
    \vs{24}'Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled.
    \vs{25}'For the land has become defiled, therefore I have brought its punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants.
    \vs{26}'But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and My judgments and shall not do any of these abominations, [neither] the native, nor the alien who sojourns among you
    \vs{27}(for the men of the land who have been before you have done all these abominations, and the land has become defiled);
    \vs{28}so that the land will not spew you out, should you defile it, as it has spewed out the nation which has been before you.
    \vs{29}'For whoever does any of these abominations, those persons who do [so] shall be cut off from among their people.
    \vs{30}'Thus you are to keep My charge, that you do not practice any of the abominable customs which have been practiced before you, so as not to defile yourselves with them; I am the LORD your God.''
\end{scripture}

\section{God's People Affected by Foreign Influence}

\begin{scripture}[Isaiah 2:6-8]
    \vs{6}For You have abandoned Your people, the house of Jacob, Because they are filled [with influences] from the east, And [they are] soothsayers like the Philistines, And they strike [bargains] with the children of foreigners.
    \vs{7}Their land has also been filled with silver and gold And there is no end to their treasures; Their land has also been filled with horses And there is no end to their chariots.
    \vs{8}Their land has also been filled with idols; They worship the work of their hands, That which their fingers have made.
\end{scripture}

\begin{scripture}[Romans 12:2]
    \vs{2}And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.
\end{scripture}

\vspace{2\baselineskip}

\begin{scripture}[1 John 2:15-17]
    \vs{15}Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
    \vs{16}For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.
    \vs{17}The world is passing away, and [also] its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives forever.
\end{scripture}

\begin{scripture}[1 Peter 2:9-12]
    \vs{9}But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR [God's] OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;
    \vs{10}for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY.
    \vs{11}Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.
    \vs{12}Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe [them], glorify God in the day of visitation.
\end{scripture}
