\chapter{Introduction}
\begin{fullwidth}
In a world where the value of life is often debated, Scripture invites us to look beyond societal opinions and into the very heart of God. 
From the first chapters of Genesis to the psalms and prophets, the Bible reveals a Creator who intricately forms life, knows us before we are born, 
and assigns purpose to every person. This study seeks to guide believers through God's Word, uncovering His deep love for the unborn and the 
responsibility we have as followers of Christ to uphold the sanctity of life. By examining key passages, we will reflect on God's character 
and align our hearts with His in defending the most vulnerable.\\

This study will operate under the a few assumptions.
\vspace{1\baselineskip}

\textbf{1. The Bible as the Word of God:} 
\marginnote{
    \begin{scripture}[2 Timothy 3:16]
            \vs{16} All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;
    \end{scripture}
}
We believe the Bible is God's inspired Word. Both the Old and New Testaments reveal His character, intentions, and heart for humanity, offering truths that are timeless and relevant.

\textbf{2. Parallels Between Ancient Israel and Followers of Christ:}
\marginnote{
    \begin{scripture}[1 Corinthians 10:11]
            \vs{11} Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.
    \end{scripture}
}

We assume that God's relationship with ancient Israel offers valuable insights for today's believers, providing examples of His guidance, discipline, and faithfulness that still apply.\\

\textbf{3. Consistent Character of God:} 
\marginnote{
    \begin{scripture}[James 1:17]
            \vs{17} Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.
    \end{scripture}
}
Although, through Christ, believers are not subject to the same Old Testament punishments for sin, we trust that God's values and character remain unchanged. The principles seen in the Old Testament still help us understand who God is and what He values.\\
