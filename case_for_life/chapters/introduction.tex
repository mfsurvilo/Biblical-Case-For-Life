This study will operate under the assumption that the Bible is the word of God and God's character and heart have been revealed for us to discover in both the Old and New Testaments.



Analogies will be drawn and assumed between the nation of God - Israel and Judah and modern-day Christians.


A note on old testament passages. Although the punishment for sin has always been death, post-Christ those who trust in His sacrificial work do not have to bear the punishments seen in the old testament. This does not mean that God's character and value system observed in the old testament no longer applies. bad wording\\

Throughout this study verses will be shown in the NASB 2020 version.
