\chapter{Child Sacrafice}

Many biblical historians believe that the phrase "passing through the fire" mentioned in the upcoming is a direct reference to the act of sacraficing children
as burnt offerings to idol gods. John Day is one of the most authoritative voices on the subject. He argues that based on what is found in the Hebrew Bible, acnient Near Eastern sources and archaeological evidence 
all points to this gruesome act. In his book on the subject, \footnote{John Day, \textit{Molech: A God of Human Sacrifice in the Old Testament} (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989).} Day highlights parallels between the descriptions
in the Bible and the practice of child sacrifice found in Phoenician colonies such as Carthage, where inscriptions explicitly mention sacrifice of children to the gods Baal and Molech. 

What does this have to do with modern day abortion? In America alone we have allowed the practice of abortion to take the lives of 25\% of the children conceived in 2020. But were these
sacraficed to the god Molech? No, they were not sacraficed to a god, but they were sacraficed to the god of convenience. The god of self. The god of personal autonomy. The god of personal freedom. The god of personal choice.

If you are still struggling to see a life inside the womb as value, this will be a difficult comparison. If however, you have come to realize God's heart for the unborn, then you will be able to draw distinct parallels between these two abominations.

We will look at the following passages \marginnote{Note: It is estimated that Leviticus and Deuteronomy were written between 1440 and 1400 BC.}
in chronological order to first be introduced to Molech, and then see how some of God's own people began to be influenced their culture and engage in this detestable practice.

\begin{scripture}[Leviticus 18:21-24]
    \vs{21}
    You shall not give any of your offspring to offer them to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God; I am the LORD.
    \vs{22}You shall not sleep with a male as one sleeps with a female; it is an abomination.
    \vs{23}Also you shall not have sexual intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion.
    \vs{24}Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these things the nations which I am driving out from you have become defiled.

\begin{scripture}[Leviticus 20:1-5]

    \vs{2}'You shall also say to the sons of Israel: 'Any man from the sons of Israel or from the aliens sojourning in Israel who gives any of his offspring to Molech, shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
    \vs{3}'I will also set My face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given some of his offspring to Molech, so as to defile My sanctuary and to profane My holy name.
    \vs{4}'If the people of the land, however, should ever disregard that man when he gives any of his offspring to Molech, so as not to put him to death,
    \vs{5}then I Myself will set My face against that man and against his family, and I will cut off from among their people both him and all those who play the harlot after him, by playing the harlot after Molech.

    \vs{30}beware that you are not ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed before you, and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, 'How do these nations serve their gods, that I also may do likewise?'
    \vs{31}You shall not behave thus toward the Lord your God, for every abominable act which the Lord hates they have done for their gods; for they even burn their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods.
    \vs{32}Whatever I command you, you shall be careful to do; you shall not add to nor take away from it.

\begin{scripture}[1 Kings 11:4-8]
    \vs{4}For when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away after other gods; and his heart was not wholly devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father [had been].
    \vs{5}For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and after Milcom the detestable idol of the Ammonites.
    \vs{6}Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not follow the LORD fully, as David his father [had done].
    \vs{7}Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable idol of Moab, on the mountain which is east of Jerusalem, and for Molech the detestable idol of the sons of Ammon.

    \vs{3}For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.
    \vs{4}He built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, 'In Jerusalem I will put My name.'
    \vs{5}For he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
