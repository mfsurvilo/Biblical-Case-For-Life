\begin{scripture}[Leviticus 20:1-5]
    \vs{1}Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
    \vs{2}'You shall also say to the sons of Israel: 'Any man from the sons of Israel or from the aliens sojourning in Israel who gives any of his offspring to Molech, shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
    \vs{3}'I will also set My face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given some of his offspring to Molech, so as to defile My sanctuary and to profane My holy name.
    \vs{4}'If the people of the land, however, should ever disregard that man when he gives any of his offspring to Molech, so as not to put him to death,
    \vs{5}then I Myself will set My face against that man and against his family, and I will cut off from among their people both him and all those who play the harlot after him, by playing the harlot after Molech.

\begin{scripture}[1 Kings 11:4-8]
    \vs{4}For when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away after other gods; and his heart was not wholly devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father [had been].
    \vs{5}For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and after Milcom the detestable idol of the Ammonites.
    \vs{6}Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not follow the LORD fully, as David his father [had done].
    \vs{7}Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable idol of Moab, on the mountain which is east of Jerusalem, and for Molech the detestable idol of the sons of Ammon.
    \vs{8}Thus also he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.

\begin{scripture}[2 Kings 21:1-6]
    \vs{1}Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hephzibah.
    \vs{2}He did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD dispossessed before the sons of Israel.
    \vs{3}For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.
    \vs{4}He built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, 'In Jerusalem I will put My name.'
    \vs{5}For he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
    \vs{6}He made his son pass through the fire, practiced witchcraft and used divination, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD provoking [Him to anger].

\begin{scripture}[2 Kings 21:11-12]
    \vs{11}'Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, having done wickedly more than all the Amorites did who [were] before him, and has also made Judah sin with his idols;
    \vs{12}therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am bringing [such] calamity on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears will tingle.
\end{scripture}

\begin{scripture}[2 Chronicles 28:1-4]
    \vs{1}Ahaz [was] twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do right in the sight of the LORD as David his father [had done].
    \vs{2}But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel; he also made molten images for the Baals.
    \vs{3}Moreover, he burned incense in the valley of Ben-hinnom and burned his sons in fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had driven out before the sons of Israel.
    \vs{4}He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills and under every green tree.
