    \vs{10}\marginnote{\question{Does Jesus recognize the authority of the government to execute capital punishment?}}

\begin{scripture}[Romans 13:1-7]
    \ch{13}Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.
    \vs{2}Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.
    \vs{3}For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same;
    \vs{4}for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.
    \vs{5}Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.
    \vs{6}For because of this you also pay taxes, for [rulers] are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.
    \vs{7}Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax [is due]; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.
