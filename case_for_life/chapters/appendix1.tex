\begin{scripture}[Isaiah 30:1-6]
    \vs{1}`Woe to the rebellious children,` declares the LORD, `Who execute a plan, but not Mine, And make an alliance, but not of My Spirit, In order to add sin to sin;
    \vs{2}Who proceed down to Egypt Without consulting Me, To take refuge in the safety of Pharaoh And to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!
    \vs{3}`Therefore the safety of Pharaoh will be your shame And the shelter in the shadow of Egypt, your humiliation.
    \vs{4}`For their princes are at Zoan And their ambassadors arrive at Hanes.
    \vs{5}`Everyone will be ashamed because of a people who cannot profit them, [Who are] not for help or profit, but for shame and also for reproach.`
    \vs{6}The oracle concerning the beasts of the Negev. Through a land of distress and anguish, From where [come] lioness and lion, viper and flying serpent, They carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys And their treasures on camels` humps, To a people who cannot profit [them];
\end{scripture}
